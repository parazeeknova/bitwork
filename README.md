### About The Project

A large portion of Indian economic activity operates outside formal employment systems. Plumbers, electricians, domestic helpers, tutors, mechanics, small vendors, and students offering part-time services often do not have access to structured marketplaces, physical shops, or stable employment contracts. At the same time, households, small businesses, and communities frequently require short-duration, task-specific work, not full-time hiring or long-term contracts.

Existing solutions focus on either full employment or gig marketplaces, which introduce high entry barriers, platform dependence, commissions, and rigid role definitions. There is a lack of systems that enable small, composable units of work to be exchanged flexibly, transparently, and locally.

### The Problem:

Informal workers lack visibility, digital presence, and proof of work without owning a shop or business. Small businesses and households often need short, specific tasks, not long-term hiring. Students and learners have limited opportunities to apply skills in real-world settings before formal employment. Existing platforms prioritize ratings, commissions, and long contracts, which discourage small-scale participation.
Trust in informal work is built through word-of-mouth and is not portable across locations.

### Social Responsibility and Ethics: 
Encourages fair access to work opportunities. Avoids exploitative gig dynamics. Supports inclusion of informal and unregistered workers. Promotes dignity of labor through contribution-based recognition.
